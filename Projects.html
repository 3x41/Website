<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>These are all mini projects that have been created. The goal is to make sure the cost is under 20 Pounds and for it to be intresting and to learn something from it.</p>

<i><center>Costing £0, I'm happy with this. Made out of a bed being throwen away, I needed something the same height as my desk and that I could fit the 3D printer on. Just a circular saw and screws and this is the result. Coud do with a little sanding down and paint later.</center></i>

<i><center>Purchased for a few pounds, I cut it in half and rewired as I wanted to use this on my DJ deck that splits the stereo plug left and right channels to mono outputs on each line. This means that you can have your headphones on the left channel and the speakers on the right channel. I should of got one in the box but didnt and nothing cheap on ebay to do the same job.</center></i>

<i><center>If your ever shopping for sun/rain covers for a wheelchair your be shocked at the amount that they can cost. I needed to get one for this chair but it would of cost £200 for the cover. Yes that much. The last chair had a £160 cover and the only difference is that they make the bracket different so nothing is changable. I brought a £12 metal bar. Cut, drilled and smoothed the rough edges on it to fit and now there is a cover that works on this wheelchair. Very happy with the result, if it wasnt so cold outside I would of made it even better but that can wait for the summer now.</center></i>

<i><center>Brought as a xmas present but found that everytime you turned it on, the lights on the DVD flickered and the backlight took ages to work if ever. Repaired 2 caps on the powerboard costing £2.67 and that seems to have fixed the issue.</center></i>

<i><center>Being stuck at home in lock-down, I was just looking at some parts I had laying around and ended up creating a small battery powered mixer. This is very simple and cost nothing to make. I started with a 1.5v battery but had to end up with a 9v battery to get more power. There is a variable resister that can be adjusted too.</center></i>

<i><center>I have slowly been starting to repair more things this year. I started off with repairing components on a power supply built in on a 22 inch monitor. This cost me about £2 in parts from a non working display to a fully working one.The screen was free as it was to be scrapped due to not working. Internal cable repair on a UV Nail Dryer as it was poorly made. Its now all working again and still going months after the repair.</center></i>

<i><center>A mini personal computer made from 2 ardunios. This was built from a guide on the internet that was just an interesting project to see how it works. One Ardunio reads the input from the PS2 keyboard and also runs Ardunio Basic, then that sends the output to the second Ardunio that just handles the video output. Power feed goes into the VGA one then shared to the other. The display is not 100% working as it not clean, I tried many things but come to the concusion that its the Ardunio nano itself is not running right. The project cost £6 for the two Ardunio nanos, and the rest was on buying the sockets and board, in total it was under £10 to build.<BR><BR>Although I cant see any use for it, it was more about the fun of building it than the end result.</center></i>

<i><center>Intrested in the tinkernut website on creating a 3D printer, the first part was to create and understand a CNC setup. This could be made out of old computer parts including 3 DVD drives, a PC power supply, some steper motor controllers and an uno board. Costing a hugh £15 to build, it was a very interesting project to create it. The main idea behind this was to build the CNC setup, then add a 3D pen to the setup and make it into a 3D printer.</center></i>

<i><center>Project RAD ONE was first thought of as a radioactive design. So knowing that I wanted a yellow theme and to Projects paint plastic, I started with making the PC work with an old GTX graphics card. Once tested, it was time to re-build the graphics card and paint it. I also striped everything out the case and painted that too. Adding cable management and trying to tidy a case that was not a good design to show off was a challenge. The side panel was going to have clear plastic but I ran out of it and changed my mind when cutting the case. Two air holes were created and then tubing put around the edging. The Power cables were modified and changed to lengthen and remove adapters and the RGB lighting was USB but that was removed and wired into the power supply to keep it tidy and so that everything was lit up when turning on the PC. Overall I am happy with the paint and plastic but the cabling could of been better.</center></i>
