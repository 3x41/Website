FishFish^2021^Love2D^assets/Games/FishFish.png^After playing SharkShark! I wanted to make my own version of the game after finding out the Amico system was delayed again. This is the most advanced Love2d Game I've done due to all the things going on in it. The game assets are all from opengameart website.

Dodge Challenge^2021^Love2D^assets/Games/DodgeChall5.png^I was trying to get back into Lua coding and ended up creating a isometic version of dodge challenge. I did try and use PyGame Zero but I just could not adjust the parts I needed to get it to work. I enjoyed working with the Love2D engine. The game assets are all from opengameart website.

Cone Track^2021^PyGame Zero^assets/Games/ConeTrack.png^I was looking at Python games and created a simple car game that you need to avoid the cones to get a high score.^none^none^

Larmers Cant Jump (PICO-8)^2020^Pico-8 (Lua)^assets/Games/larmerscantjump_000.png^Simple endless runner that you must collect the coins while avoiding the spikes. This was made very hard as everything speeds up when you collect a coin. This had quite a bit of animation for the main character.^none^none^

Space (PICO-8)^2020^Pico-8 (Lua)^assets/Games/space_000.png^Very simple space shooter that was part of a guide, this was really helpful as it showed me some better ways to use lua tables and effects.^none^none^

Find the Ball (PICO-8)^2019^Pico-8 (Lua)^assets/Games/tubble_000.png^Very simple. You must guess what cup the ball is under. I wanted to do move movement/ animation but this turned out harder than I expected.^none^none^

Pipe Faller (PICO-8)^2019^Pico-8 (Lua)^assets/Games/pipefaller_001.png^This was to be a remake of Pipe Climber but on the Pico-8 instead. An intresting project but not as good as the PipeClimber version.^none^none^

Subhunt^2019^Love2D (Lua)^assets/Games/subhunter_l2d.png^Created in Love2D, this was a project that just lost its fun creating but I wanted to get it to a sort of finished state. You control a ship that can move left and right. You can drop a bomb but only one at a time. The enemy subs are firing up at you. Live as long as you can.^none^none^

Blocky Bird^2018^Love2D (Lua)^assets/Games/BlockyBird.png^Carrying on with using Love2d, As I was playing around with it I ended up creating a flappy bird clone. I am very happy with the result as this was created from scratch and no code was copied from anywhere. Simply press the spacebar to go higher and make it though the pipes. The gap between the pipes gets smaller as you go along.^none^none^

Opposite Quick^2018^Love2D (Lua)^assets/Games/Opposite_Quick.png^I wanted to created another small game in the love2d engine but make something different to what I am used to making. Under 300 lines of Lua code later we have Opposite Quick. You have 25 questions and 3 seconds to decide what to do on each. Do you click or not?^none^none^
Fruity^2018^Love2D (Lua)^assets/Games/Fruity.jpg^Created in Love2d (Lua coding) this was a first time fun little project to mainly just to learn how the Love engine works and I have to say that I really enjoyed it.

Fisshy^2017^Blender3D^assets/Games/Fisshy.png^This game has been a hard project to finish due to other things going on. You control an orange fish collecting food, you must avoid big red as he's trying to eat you. Designed to be a low poly style game, this one level game has some features that are interesting. One of the biggest features is that when big red is near you, your hear a heartbeat warning you.^none^none^
MineTest Mod^2017^Lua^assets/Games/MineTest_Pack.png^With hours wasted on the game MineTest, I wanted letters so that words could be made in the game. This is a very basic Mod that gives you extra nodes on the creative mode of the game.^none^none^
Lunar Lander^2017^Click Fusion 2.5^assets/Games/LunarRescue.png^Based on an old game, Lunar Rescue is a small 10 level game. You have to pilot a space craft and pick up the spacemen one at a time and drop them off at the flag. Try to complete the game with the least amount of crashes.^none^none^

Spot The Differnce^2016^Blender3D^assets/Games/SpotTheDiff.png^Inspired by playing a spot the difference on a tablet. I wanted to see how easy it is to create a similar game. This is the first time that I have created a menu (like the style of MortorMan). The image is moving making it hard to find the differences. There are three puzzles in total all based on Christmas.^none^none^
Tanks^2016^Blender3D^assets/Games/Tanks.png^This is the first game in many years to have an AI computer player and is the most complex game so far this year.

Bouncing Ball Challenge^2016^Blender3D^assets/Games/BouncingBall.png^First proper 3D game since playing with Unity. You control a bouncing ball and have to get your way though the course to the end marker without falling to your death. This is only one level but it was the first 3D game that works well and I am very happy with what was created. All the sounds and music were created by myself.^none^none^
Subhunter^2013^GameMaker 7 (MAC)^assets/Games/SubHunter.png^Remake game of the Windows 3.1 game created many years ago. I wanted to see how quick something like this could be made in gamemaker.

There are 50 cars to avoid with things speeding up as you go along. Good Luck.^none^none^

Games in the 1990s^1990^PC &amp; Atari STe^assets/Games/Atari_ST.jpg^In the 90s, a few games created in QBasic and then later QBasic 4.5. Visual Basic Version 3 was used later on. One of the games created in VB3 was Subhunter. This worked very well but sadly over time the source code has been lost. The first games ever created started in STOS on the Atari ST. Dodge Challenge 1 &amp; 2 were created using this. It was mouse controlled avoiding the oncoming cars. This was a top down view game and took months to create.<BR><BR>STOS, AMOS, VB 3, QBasic and more...^none^none^
