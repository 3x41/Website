At the time its selling for £100, not worth it at all but I managed to ebay win one for £25 and it is worth it for that price. The great thing is that you can put games in the slot but its really let down by its sound chip. Really let down by the sound, it just feels off-key and slow. Also some games do not work 100% when putting the cartridge in. I will keep it and this has lead me to buy a real megadrive..</td>
